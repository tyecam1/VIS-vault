## Updates
- Added Valve Index headset asset note (`HMD-VALVE-INDEX-01`) with storage and kit link to mocap kit; noted outstanding serial/base station details to capture.
- Updated Vive mocap kit assets to include the Valve Index and reflect SteamVR headset availability.
- Expanded inventory headsets section to list the Valve Index entry for dashboard/bookings.
- Reformatted `work-log.md` to standard daily note structure (dates, hours, tasks, blockers) and corrected malformed date entry.
- Rewrote `sop/SOP-VIVE-3D-DESIGN-01` to document the SolidWorks → STEP → FreeCAD → OBJ (+MTL) → Unity pipeline, including cleaning guidance, mesh tessellation settings, and Unity scaling/material import notes.

## Follow-ups / Tasks
- Record the exact serial numbers for the Valve Index headset, controllers, and base stations, plus any MAC addresses, and update the asset note.
- Confirm the Valve Index accessories (base stations, mounts, storage bin) are stored with the mocap kit and adjust kit/asset notes if needed.
- Run a trial export with a representative assembly to validate the updated FreeCAD → OBJ pipeline settings (tessellation quality, material mapping) and capture any Unity import tweaks.
