## 2024-12-04
- **Hours:** 8
- **Tasks Completed**:
	- Finalised the Unity XR pipeline for the untethered HTC Vive Focus Vision, including:
    - A stable passthrough-ready scene aligned to the physical room
    - A documented workflow and SOP for importing engineering models
    - A validated demonstration scene
        
	- Established the simplest reliable STEP→OBJ workflow, confirming that Blender is unnecessary.  
	- Identified FreeCAD + STEP (AP214/242) as the stable conversion path for SolidWorks assemblies.
	- Added the missing Valve Index entry to the inventory and updated the headset structure accordingly
- **Blockers:**
	- Need to standardise the HTC Vive setup SOP (SteamVR initialisation and Vive IoT connection).
	- Unreal Engine installation for a colleague is still pending.

	- Created a Unity material palette (metals, plastics, rubber, wood, safety) and applied it to the Vive demo assembly; demo scene now polished and showcase-ready.    
	- Updated the 3D design SOP: corrected origin/orientation section, reframed STEP/MTL materials as semantic hints, documented Unity’s material handling, and added Section 0 for connecting the Vive Focus Vision to the VIS workstation via RC545 IoT 5 GHz.
	- Clarified handling of Vive “centre of play” changes and documented how to realign assemblies without altering Unity’s fixed MR origin.
	- Organised the secure VR locker and replaced the storage note with a clear access/return policy (contact for key, strict separation of headset kits, return items as found).
