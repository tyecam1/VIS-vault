## 2025-12-04

- **Hours:** 8
    
- **Delivered:**
    
    - Finalised Unity XR pipeline for HTC Vive Focus Vision (untethered MR), including:
        
        - Passthrough-ready scene aligned to the physical room.
            
        - Validated demonstration scene.
            
        - Documented import workflow for engineering CAD models.
            
    - Reliable SolidWorks assembly conversion route: STEP (AP214/AP242) → FreeCAD → OBJ, Blender unnecessary for the core pipeline.
        
    - Updated inventory and dashboards:
        
        - Added missing Valve Index entry and updated headset structure for bookings/dashboards.
            
        - Created asset note `HMD-VALVE-INDEX-01`; flagged missing serial numbers and base station details.
            
        - Updated Vive mocap kit definition to reflect SteamVR headset availability.
            
    - Standardised documentation structure: reformatted **`work-log.md`** into a consistent daily-note format.
        
    - Rewrote `sop/SOP-VIVE-3D-DESIGN-01` to capture end-to-end workflow, including mesh cleaning guidance, tessellation settings, Unity scale correction, and material import/remapping notes.
        
- **Open issues:**
    
    - Standardise and document HTC Vive (SteamVR) setup, including SteamVR initialisation and wireless/IoT connection procedure.
        
    - Unreal Engine installation pending for colleague.
        
    - Meta Quest 2 setup incomplete, no validated workflow.
        

## 2025-12-09

- **Hours:** 6
    
- **Delivered:**
    
    - Programmed and applied a Unity canonical material palette (metals, plastics, rubber, wood, safety) to the Vive demo assembly; demo scene polished for showcasing.
        
    - Updated 3D design SOP, including:
        
        - Corrected origin/orientation guidance.
            
        - Documented Unity material palette usage.
            
        - Added Section 0 covering Vive Focus Vision connection to VIS workstation via RC545 IoT 5 GHz wifi.
            
    - Documented handling of Vive “centre of play” changes and realignment approach without altering Unity’s fixed MR origin.
        
    - Organised secure VR locker and replaced storage note with a clear access/return.
    

## 2026-01-09 (Work block B)

- **Hours:** 8
    
- **Activity:** PC upgrade for higher-intensity work. Witnessed Unreal simulations unable to run previously.
