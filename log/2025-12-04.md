## Updates
- Added Valve Index headset asset note (`HMD-VALVE-INDEX-01`) with storage and kit link to mocap kit; noted outstanding serial/base station details to capture.
- Updated Vive mocap kit assets to include the Valve Index and reflect SteamVR headset availability.
- Expanded inventory headsets section to list the Valve Index entry for dashboard/bookings.
- Reformatted `work-log.md` to standard daily note structure (dates, hours, tasks, blockers) and corrected malformed date entry.

## Follow-ups / Tasks
- Record the exact serial numbers for the Valve Index headset, controllers, and base stations, plus any MAC addresses, and update the asset note.
- Confirm the Valve Index accessories (base stations, mounts, storage bin) are stored with the mocap kit and adjust kit/asset notes if needed.
- Added YAML front matter to `sop/SOP-VIVE-3D-DESIGN-01` to align metadata (ID, asset group, kit linkage placeholder, users) with other VIS SOPs.
