### 2025-11-14

- **Hours:** 8
    
- **Activity:** Troubleshot the existing HTC Vive and Unity configuration previously established.
    
- **Outcome:** Identified blockers preventing a stable, repeatable workflow (details not recorded in source notes).

### 2025-11-28

- **Hours:** 2
    
- **Activity:** Produced an initial SOP for Vive + SolidWorks 3D design workflow.
    
- **Outcome:** Baseline procedure documented (later expanded and formalised in December).
    

### 2025-12-04

- **Hours:** 8
    
- **Delivered:**
    
    - Finalised Unity XR pipeline for HTC Vive Focus Vision (untethered MR), including:
        
        - Passthrough-ready scene aligned to the physical room.
            
        - Demonstration scene validated.
            
        - Documented import workflow for engineering CAD models.
            
    - Established a reliable SolidWorks assembly conversion route via STEP (AP214/AP242) → FreeCAD → OBJ, noting Blender not required for the core pipeline.
        
    - Added the missing Valve Index entry to inventory and updated headset structure for dashboards/bookings.
        
    - Created asset note `HMD-VALVE-INDEX-01`; flagged missing serial numbers and base station details.
        
    - Updated the Vive mocap kit definition to reflect SteamVR headset availability.
    
    - Reformatted `work-log.md` into a consistent daily-note structure.
        
    - Rewrote `sop/SOP-VIVE-3D-DESIGN-01` to document the end-to-end pipeline, including:
        
        - Mesh cleaning guidance
            
        - Tessellation settings
            
        - Unity scale correction
            
        - Material import/remapping notes
            
- Open issues:
    
    - HTC Vive (SteamVR) setup requires standardisation and documentation (SteamVR initialisation + wireless/IoT connection SOP).
        
    - Unreal Engine installation for colleague pending.
        
    - Meta Quest 2 setup incomplete; no validated workflow.
        

### 2025-12-09

- **Hours:** 6
    
- **Delivered:**
    
    - Programmed and applied a Unity material palette (metals, plastics, rubber, wood, safety) to the Vive demo assembly; demo scene polished for showcasing.
        
    - Updated the 3D design SOP:
        
        - Corrected origin/orientation guidance.
            
        - Reframed STEP/MTL materials as semantic hints rather than ground-truth appearance.
            
        - Documented Unity canonical palette usage.
            
        - Added a Section 0 covering Vive Focus Vision connection to VIS workstation via RC545 IoT 5 GHz.
            
    - Documented handling of Vive “centre of play” changes and realignment approach without altering Unity’s fixed MR origin.
        
    - Organised the secure VR locker and replaced the storage note with a clear access/return policy (key-holder contact, kit separation, return-as-found requirement).

### 2025-12-09

- **Hours:** 8
    
- **Delivered:**
    
- Complete reset on a more powerful PC for more intensive future work. Reinstalled and reconfigured all existing software.

- Installed Valve Index brackets into RC545
