### **Rules for Use**

#### **1. Keep VR kits strictly separate**

Each headset (Vive, Quest, XREAL, Index etc.) has its own allocated space and may include:
- The headset
- Controllers
- Charging cables
- Adapters or sensors
- Any additional accessories

**Do not mix equipment between kits.**  
Do not store “spares” in another headset’s section.

---

#### **2. Return items exactly as you found them**

Before returning equipment to the locker:

- Ensure the correct components are returned to the correct headset section.
- Coil and secure cables neatly.
- Place controllers in their marked position.
- Put everything back in the correct box.


This prevents damage, loss, and delays for other users.

#### **3. Report issues immediately**

If anything is:

- Missing
- Not charging
- Not tracking
- Damaged  
    
Please email:  
	tye.cameron-robson@strath.ac.uk  
with the headset name and description of the issue.

#### **4. Keep the locker locked at all times**

The locker must remain locked when not actively in use.  
Do not leave items out on desks without supervision.
