# **RC545a VIS Storage and Equipment Management Policy**

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the rules and procedures for storing, accessing, and returning XR, AR, and interaction equipment used in the RC545a Visualisation and Interaction Suite (VIS).

The goals are to:

- Protect high-value and fragile equipment
    
- Ensure rapid, reliable setup for teaching, research, and demonstrations
    
- Prevent loss or mixing of components between VR systems
    
- Maintain a clear chain of responsibility for access and fault reporting
    

This policy applies to staff, students, and visitors using VIS equipment.

## 2. Secure Storage and Access

### 2.1 Storage location

All VR, AR, and interaction equipment is stored in a locked secure locker adjacent to RC545a.

---

### 2.2 Key access

Access to the locker is controlled.

To obtain the locker key, contact:

**Tye Cameron**  
tye.cameron-robson@strath.ac.uk

The locker must remain locked when not actively in use.

---

## 3. Core Storage Rule: Keep VR Kits Separate

Each VR headset system is treated as a self-contained kit, consisting of:

- Headset
    
- Controllers
    
- Charging cables
    
- Adapters
    
- Sensors or accessories specific to that system
    

Equipment from different VR systems must never be mixed.

Examples:

- Quest controllers must not be stored with Vive equipment
    
- Vive trackers must not be placed with Quest or XREAL items
    
- Chargers and adapters must remain with their original headset system
    

If an item does not fit back into the space where it was found, it is in the wrong place.

---

## 4. Return Procedure (Mandatory)

Before returning equipment to the locker, users must:

1. Confirm all components belong to the same VR system
    
2. Neatly coil and secure all cables
    
3. Place controllers, sensors, and accessories in their designated positions
    
4. Return the headset and accessories **exactly as they were found**
    
5. Lock the locker once all items are returned
    

Partial returns or “temporary” placement outside the locker are not permitted.

---

## 5. Charging Rules

- Charging is carried out outside the locker
    
- Devices should be charged before being returned to storage where possible
    
- Charging cables at the workstation must not be removed from that area
    

Equipment should only be returned to the locker once charging is complete and all components are accounted for.

---

## 6. Fault Reporting and Missing Items

Any of the following must be reported immediately:

- Missing components
    
- Damage
    
- Tracking or controller issues
    
- Charging failures
    
- Unlabelled or misplaced equipment
    

Report issues by emailing:

tye.cameron-robson@strath.ac.uk

Include:

- The headset or kit name
    
- A brief description of the issue
    

Do **not** attempt to substitute parts from another kit to “make it work”.

---

## 7. Identification and Labelling

- All major devices (will be) labelled with VIS asset IDs
    
- Storage locations are labelled to indicate correct placement
    
- Labels and markings must not be removed or altered
    

If a label is missing or damaged, report it.

---

## 8. Responsibility

Users are responsible for:

- Equipment from the moment it is removed from the locker
    
- Returning equipment in the correct condition and configuration
    
- Reporting issues honestly and promptly
    

Failure to follow this policy may result in loss of access to VIS equipment.
